### CCG Engine Template

This is a template project containing a fully functioning but not fully featured CCG engine for a card game like Magic: the Gathering or YuGiOh.
Card saving is based on Resources and card effects are based on Actions that are passed back to the game state.
Currently implemented are a debug game with an example implementation for a turn/mana system and card effects and a collection manager that can add
new decks. The template doesn't currently support editing decks, however.
